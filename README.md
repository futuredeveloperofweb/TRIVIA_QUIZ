1. **Presentation Tier (Frontend)**
   - **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (optional but recommended for enhanced user experience)
   - **Purpose:** This layer is responsible for the user interface and user experience. It will handle the presentation of quizzes, user authentication, and interactions.

2. **Application Tier (Backend)**
   - **Technologies:** Django (Python)
   - **Purpose:** This layer is responsible for the business logic of the application. It will handle user authentication, quiz management, scoring, and user performance tracking.

3. **Data Tier (Database)**
   - **Technologies:** PostgreSQL (recommended for its advanced features and reliability)
   - **Purpose:** This layer is responsible for data storage, retrieval, and management. It will store user data, quizzes, scores, and other related information.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - React.js (for enhanced interactivity)
  - Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS (for styling)
